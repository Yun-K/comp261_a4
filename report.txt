I finish stage 0, 1, 2, 3, didnot do the stage 4 which is the challenge one.
Also, I answer the additional questions which can be seen in WrittenAnswers.pdf.

For the convenience, some of the classes are built inside some of the java classes, 
for example: inside OP.java, also there are add,sub,div,mul classes.



For the parser, it can throw parseFailureError successfully on all the 
provided bad prog, and can parse the good prog (simple, full) successfully.
When the parser parse the good prog, the parsed string will be printed in the terminal,
but the syntax looks ugly since the indentation is not set well in each of the toString methods.

By the way, since stage2 use the EXP which cause SEN and NUM belongs to the EXP, 
so some of the s1_badProg can also be parsed and run successfully.

For the RobotGame, I try to read the prog file and see what is happened when load the prog 
to the Robot, seems like the robot can all run what the prog file expected.
